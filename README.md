# Heart Disease Prediction Using AI

## Overview

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical parameters. The model uses patient health data to assess risk and support medical decision-making.

## Goal

To develop a reliable, interpretable model that can classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease or not.

## Technologies

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook
